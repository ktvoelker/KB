Separate layout and color/font details into two separate module groups

  And standardize on pluralization of module names

Make buttons light up on hover

Figure out the best alignment for things

effect of white-backed boxes hovering just above it

Add tag support

Improve focus control and keyboard shortcuts

  Have a triangular cursor indicating the current note

Make the textarea grow as text is entered

Display times nicely

Search

Better handling of errors

Logout

API tests

UI module tests

Creation time on persons

Delete empty tags

Track the amount of space a user's notes take up
  Include tags - this means tags have to have their creators tracked

Figure out how to make sure URLs in index.html always work
  If accessed as /static/index.html, they won't work right now
  How about making a route for /static/index.html that redirects to /?
